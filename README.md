# SnappyPixels
Here you may find important files for my company --- SnappyPixels. These are publically accessable scripts and html code for my sites, games, and game launcher.
95% of my games and sites are written in C#, HTML, and CSS. You will find the source code here, but not how to build it. 

# Crediting
You may use my scripts and code. BUT, if you decide to clone my launcher or use the template you must give credit.
